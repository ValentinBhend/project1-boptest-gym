# BOPTEST-Gym

BOPTESTS-Gym is the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) environment of the [BOPTEST](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest) framework. This repository accommodates the BOPTEST API to the Gymnasium standard in order to facilitate the implementation, assessment and benchmarking of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for their application in building energy management. RL algorithms from the [Stable-Baselines 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) repository are used to exemplify and test this framework. 

The environment is described in [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354386346_An_OpenAI-Gym_environment_for_the_Building_Optimization_Testing_BOPTEST_framework). 

## Structure
- `boptestGymEnv.py` contains the core functionality of this Gymnasium environment.
- `environment.yml` contains the dependencies required to run this software. 
- `/examples` contains prototype code for the interaction of RL algorithms with an emulator building model from BOPTEST. 
- `/testing` contains code for testing this software. 

## Quick-Start

1) Create an environment from the `environment.yml` file provided (instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)). You can also see our Dockerfile in [testing/Dockerfile](testing/Dockerfile) that we use to define our testing environment. 
2) Run the example below that uses the [Bestest hydronic case with a heat-pump](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/tree/master/testcases/bestest_hydronic_heat_pump) and the [DQN algorithm](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/dqn.html) from Stable-Baselines: 

```python
from boptestGymEnv import BoptestGymEnv, NormalizedObservationWrapper, DiscretizedActionWrapper
from stable_baselines3 import DQN

# url for the BOPTEST service. 
url = 'https://api.boptest.net' 

# Decide the state-action space of your test case
env = BoptestGymEnv(
        url                  = url,
        testcase             = 'bestest_hydronic_heat_pump',
        actions              = ['oveHeaPumY_u'],
        observations         = {'time':(0,604800),
                                'reaTZon_y':(280.,310.),
                                'TDryBul':(265,303),
                                'HDirNor':(0,862),
                                'InternalGainsRad[1]':(0,219),
                                'PriceElectricPowerHighlyDynamic':(-0.4,0.4),
                                'LowerSetp[1]':(280.,310.),
                                'UpperSetp[1]':(280.,310.)}, 
        predictive_period    = 24*3600, 
        regressive_period    = 6*3600, 
        random_start_time    = True,
        max_episode_length   = 24*3600,
        warmup_period        = 24*3600,
        step_period          = 3600)

# Normalize observations and discretize action space
env = NormalizedObservationWrapper(env)
env = DiscretizedActionWrapper(env,n_bins_act=10)

# Instantiate an RL agent
model = DQN('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1, gamma=0.99,
            learning_rate=5e-4, batch_size=24, 
            buffer_size=365*24, learning_starts=24, train_freq=1)

# Main training loop
model.learn(total_timesteps=10)

# Loop for one episode of experience (one day)
done = False
obs, _ = env.reset()
while not done:
  action, _ = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True) 
  obs,reward,terminated,truncated,info = env.step(action)
  done = (terminated or truncated)

# Obtain KPIs for evaluation
env.get_kpis()

```

In [this tutorial](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest-gym/blob/master/docs/tutorials/CCAI_Summer_School_2022/Building_Control_with_RL_using_BOPTEST.ipynb) you can find more details on how to use BOPTEST-Gym and on RL applied to buildings in general. 

### Note 1: on running BOPTEST in the server vs. locally
The previous example interacts with BOPTEST in a server at `https://api.boptest.net` which is readily available anytime. Interacting with BOPTEST from this server requires less configuration effort but is slower because of the communication overhead between the agent and the test case running in the cloud. Use this approach when you want to quickly check out the functionality of this repository. 

If you prioritize speed (which is usually the case when training RL agents), running BOPTEST locally is substantially faster. 
You can do so by downloading the BOPTEST repository and running:
```bash
docker compose up web worker provision

```

Further details in the [BOPTEST GitHub page](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/blob/master/README.md#quick-start-to-deploy-and-use-boptest-on-a-local-computer). 

Then you only need to change the `url` to point to your local BOPTEST service deployment instead of the remote server (`url = 'http://127.0.0.1').

### Note 2: on running BOPTEST locally in a vectorized environment

BOPTEST allows the deployment of multiple test case instances using Docker Compose. 
Running a vectorized environment enables the deployment of as many BoptestGymEnv instances as cores you have available for the agent to learn from all of them in parallel. See [here](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/vec_envs.html) for more information, we specifically use [`SubprocVecEnv`](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/vec_envs.html#subprocvecenv). This can substantially speed up the training process. 

To do so, deploy BOPTEST with multiple workers to spin multiple test cases. See the example below that prepares BOPTEST to spin two test cases.

```bash
docker compose up --scale worker=2 web worker provision
```

Then you can train an RL agent with parallel learning with the vectorized BOPTEST-gym environment. See [`/examples/run_vectorized.py`](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest-gym/blob/master/examples/run_vectorized.py) for an example on how to do so. 

### Note 3: on reducing the overhead per step

- `fast=True` asks the BOPTEST runtime to use its low-overhead simulation path, which steps the emulator FMU directly instead of building a simulation algorithm and result handler for every control step. Measurements and KPIs are unchanged. It is sent as a request when the test case is selected, so a BOPTEST deployment that does not support it simply ignores it and everything keeps working.

- `warmup_interval=<seconds>` coarsens the warmup simulation that every episode reset performs. The default of 30 reproduces earlier behaviour. A larger value makes resets cheaper but slightly moves the state reached at the start time, and with it the reported KPIs; control steps always use 30 s. A BOPTEST that does not support it ignores it.

Independently of those, the reward now asks BOPTEST only for the KPIs it reads (`cost_tot` and `tdis_tot`, listed in `REWARD_KPIS`) rather than for all of them. The peak demand KPIs are maxima over the whole test period and so get more expensive the longer an episode runs, while these two do not. A BOPTEST that does not support requesting a subset returns the full set, which is still correct, so this needs no configuration and never fails.

### Note 4: on running BOPTEST in the same process

`local=True` runs BOPTEST's own `TestCase` inside the Python process that runs the agent, instead of talking to a web service. A step then involves no HTTP request, no redis round trip and no JSON encoding. Results are unchanged: the code that simulates is the same code the BOPTEST worker runs.

```python
env = BoptestGymEnv(testcase='bestest_hydronic_heat_pump',
                    local=True,
                    boptest_root='/path/to/project1-boptest',
                    fast=True,
                    ...)
```

Two requirements come with it, both from BOPTEST rather than from this repository:

- **`pyfmi` must be importable and the test case FMU must load.** The distributed FMUs are JModelica built and need `libgfortran.so.4`, which the BOPTEST `worker` image provides and a current Linux distribution generally does not. Running inside that image is the supported way to satisfy this.
- **One environment per process.** Every BOPTEST test case FMU declares `canBeInstantiatedOnlyOncePerProcess=true`, so a second test case in the same process corrupts both without reporting an error. To run several, give each its own process with [`SubprocVecEnv`](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/vec_envs.html#subprocvecenv), as in Note 2. Each environment process holds roughly 130 MB beyond what it shares, so budget about one environment per core rather than hundreds.

`boptest_root` points at a checkout of [ibpsa/project1-boptest](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest) containing the test case FMUs, and defaults to the `BOPTEST_ROOT` environment variable. Each environment gets a temporary directory of its own for the files `TestCase` writes; `stop()` removes it.

## Versioning and main dependencies

Current BOPTEST-Gym version is `v0.8.0` which is compatible with BOPTEST `v0.8.0` 
(BOPTEST-Gym version should always be even with the BOPTEST version used). 
The framework has been tested with `gymnasium==0.28.1` and `stable-baselines3==2.0.0`.
You can see [testing/Dockerfile](testing/Dockerfile) for a full description of the testing environment.
